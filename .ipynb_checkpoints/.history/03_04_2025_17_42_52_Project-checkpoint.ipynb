    "The data being utilized in the following report was collected by a team of researchers at the University of British Columbia, led by Frank Wood. The aim of collecting the data was to predict how people play video games (through various factors). The particular video game being played is Minecraft (which is an open world simulation game, in which players maneuver through a world made of blocks – they may encounter enemies, build large structures, or just adventure).\n",
    "The gathered data consists of 2 files – (a) a file containing a list of all unique players, which includes data about each player, and (b) a file containing a list of individual playing sessions, which includes data about each session.\n"
